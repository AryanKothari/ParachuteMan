<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: Parachute Man </h1>
 
<strong>Interaction</strong>: So far in this project, I am not including an interaction. However, what I will do is include box2D so that my falling object looks more realistic. I will include physical forces such as gravity, wind speed, etc. I will also use this for collisions. 
 
<strong>Description</strong>: In this game, a man will be falling from the sky while wearing a parachute. However, as he falls, he must dodge the birds, while collecting the coins. If he hits the bird thrice, he dies, and game over. But be CAREFUL! Wind Speed may be strong, and it just may not be that easy ;) Good Luck Summoner.
